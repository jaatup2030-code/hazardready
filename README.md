### Sample Teacher Report Output (TO BE IMPROVED)

**Example: Indivdual Student Report**
Student: Mateo Aquino
----------------------------------
Topic Mastery:
Variables: 85%  (Improved from 65% last month)
Conditionals: 60%  (Needs review)
Loops: 78%  (Steady)
Functions: 55%  (Lowest mastery)

Strength: Variables
Weakness: Functions
Recommended Focus: Functions & Conditionals
Trend: Overall improving (+10% average over last 4 weeks)

 **Example: Class Summary Report**
Class: Section Carnation - CS2
----------------------------------
Average Mastery:
Variables: 80%
Conditionals: 62%
Loops: 75%
Functions: 58%

Weakest Topic (Class-wide): Functions
Strongest Topic: Variables

Patterns Observed:
- 70% of students show a drop in Function mastery after Week 3.
- Students who struggle with Conditionals often struggle with Loops.

Suggested Teacher Action:
- Conduct review activities for Functions and Conditionals.
- Pair students strong in Loops with those struggling in related topics.
