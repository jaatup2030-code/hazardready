# HazardReady: Personalized Disaster Risk & Preparedness Planner

## Project Overview
HazardReady is a simple, user-friendly tool designed to help families **prepare for natural hazards** such as typhoons, floods, and earthquakes. The project generates a **personalized emergency plan** based on the user’s home structure, location, family members, pets, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide **practical, actionable guidance** that is easy to follow, even for students and families with no technical background.

## Problem Statement
Most disaster preparedness guides are **too generic**, making it difficult for families to adapt advice to their specific situations. This often leads to underprepared households during real emergencies. HazardReady addresses this by **customizing checklists and plans** according to each user’s unique circumstances.

- Calculate a **risk score** for hazards (low, moderate, high).
