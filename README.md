# HazardReady: Personalized Disaster Risk & Preparedness Planner

## Project Overview
HazardReady is a user-friendly application designed to assist families in **preparing for natural hazards**, such as typhoons, floods, and earthquakes. The program generates a **personalized emergency plan** based on the user’s house type, location, family members, pets, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide **practical and actionable guidance** that is easy to follow, even for students and families with no technical background.

## Problem Statement
Existing disaster preparedness guides are often **too generic**, making it difficult for families to adapt advice to their specific circumstances. This can result in households being underprepared during emergencies. HazardReady addresses this issue by **creating customized checklists and emergency plans** tailored to each user’s unique situation.

---

## Project Objectives
The objectives of HazardReady are to:
1. Generate a **personalized emergency checklist** based on user inputs.  
2. Calculate a **risk score** for natural hazards (low, moderate, high).  
3. Provide a **family communication plan** and suggested evacuation strategies.  
4. Assess the **readiness of the family’s go-bag**.  
5. Offer **practical recommendations** to improve household safety.
